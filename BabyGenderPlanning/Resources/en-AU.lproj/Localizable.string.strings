"about_freymanDobrotin" = "    This method was developed by Michael Freiman according to statistics of Svyatoslav Dobrotin, professor of the medical department of the Nizhegorodsky Medical State University. This statistics was drafted and checked during the Svyatoslav Dobrotin work in the I Maternity Home as chief medical officer in the Gorky city. The predictions were right in 99 cases of 100.

    The spouses, who decided to have a baby, had to set a possible conception date, that is on 10-15 day since the new menstrual cycle. Then, by the parents' birthdays, define the baby's gender that is expected on your chosen conception day. If the prediction result won't be favorable, reschedule the conception for the next month and repeat calculation.";

"about_bloodRenewal" = "    Due to this method the baby's gender depens on the parents' blood - who has the freshest blood. Thus, if father has the blood renewal date later than mother's, they will have a boy. And vise versa.

    The blood has the property to renew. Woman's renew cycle takes 1 time in 3 years, man's cycle takes 1 time in 4 years. If woman's cycle was earlier the baby's gender will be female, If man's cycle was earlier the baby's gender will be male. In this case the Rhesus factor is very important. If mother has a negative Rhesus factor, the baby's gender will depends on the fact who has the stagnater blood.

    The blood loss directly affects on blood renewal cycles. The blood loss means loos of more than 400 ml. For example: abdominal surgery or laparoscopical surgery, blood transfusion, donorship, the big blood loss by an accident, etc. For women it needs to take into account delivery (first or last), termination of pregnancy, loss of a baby.";
